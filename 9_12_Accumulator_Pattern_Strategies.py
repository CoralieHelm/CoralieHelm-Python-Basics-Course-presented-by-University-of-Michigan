#9.12. 👩‍💻 Accumulator Pattern Strategies

#seqmut-11-1: Does the following prompt require an accumulation pattern?
#If so, what words indicate that? For each string in wrds, add ‘ed’ to the
#end of the word (to make the word past tense).
#Save these past tense words to a list called past_wrds.

#A. Yes; "save... to a list" ✔️ Correct!


#seqmut-11-2: Does the following prompt require an accumulation pattern? If so, what words indicate that? Write code to sum up all of the numbers in the list seat_counts.
#Store that number in the variable total_seat_counts.

# A. Yes; "to sum up" ✔️ Correct!



#seqmut-11-3: Does the following prompt require an accumulation pattern? If so, what words indicate that?
#Write code to print out each character of the string my_str on a separate line.

#C. No ✔️ Correct!




#seqmut-11-4: Does the following prompt require an accumulation pattern?
#If so, what words indicate that? Write code that will count the number of vowels in the sentence s
#and assign the result to the variable num_vowels.

#B. Yes; "code that will count" ✔️ Correct!



#seqmut-11-5: What type should be used for the accumulator variable in the
#following prompt? Write code that will count the number of
#vowels in the sentence s and assign the result to the variable num_vowels.

#C. integer ✔️ Yes, because we want to keep track of a number.



#seqmut-11-7: What type should be used for the accumulator variable in the following prompt? For each string in wrds, add ‘ed’ to the end of the word (to make the word past tense).
#Save these past tense words to a list called past_wrds.

#B. list ✔️ Yes, because we want a new list at the end of the code.



#seqmut-11-6: What sequence will you iterate through as you accumulate a result in the following prompt? Write code that will count the number of
#vowels in the sentence s and assign the result to the variable num_vowels.

#B. s ✔️ Yes, that is the sequence you will iterate through!




#seqmut-11-7: What type should be used for the accumulator variable in the following prompt? For each string in wrds, add ‘ed’ to the end of the word (to make the word past tense).
#Save these past tense words to a list called past_wrds.


#B. list ✔️ Yes, because we want a new list at the end of the code.


#seqmut-11-8: What sequence will you iterate through as you accumulate a result in the following prompt? For each string in wrds, add ‘ed’ to the end of the word (to make the word past tense).
#Save these past tense words to a list called past_wrds.

#A. wrds ✔️ Yes, that is the sequence you will iterate through!



#seqmut-11-9: What type should be used for the accumulator variable in the following prompt? Write code to sum up all of the numbers in the list seat_counts. Store that number in the variable total_seat_counts.

#C. integer ✔️ Yes, because we want to keep track of a number.

#seqmut-11-10: What sequence will you iterate through as you accumulate a result in the following prompt? Write code to sum up all of the numbers in the list seat_counts. Store that number in the variable total_seat_counts.

#A. seat_counts ✔️ Yes, that is the sequence you will iterate through!

#seqmut-11-11: What type should be used for the accumulator variable in the following prompt? Write code to print out each character of the string my_str on a separate line.

#D. none, there is no accumulator variable. ✔️ Correct, because this prompt does not require an accumulator pattern


#seqmut-11-12: What sequence will you iterate through as you accumulate a result in the following prompt? Write code to print out each character of the string my_str on a separate line.

#A. my_str ✔️ Yes, that is the sequence you will iterate through!

#seqmut-11-13: Which of these are good alternatives to the accumulator variable and iterator variable names for the following prompt? For each string in wrds, add ‘ed’ to the end of the word (to make the word past tense). Save these past tense words to a list called past_wrds.

#A. Accumulator Variable: wrds_so_far ; Iterator Variable: wrd ✔️ Yes, this is the most clear combination of accumulator and iterator variables.


#seqmut-11-14: WWhich of these are good alternatives to the accumulator variable and iterator variable names for the following prompt? Write code that will count the number of vowels in the sentence s and assign the result to the variable num_vowels.

#B. Accumulator Variable: total_so_far ; Iterator Variable: letter ✔️ Yes! Both the accumulator and iterator variable are clear.

#seqmut-11-15: Which of these are good alternatives to the accumulator variable and iterator variable names for the following prompt? Write code to sum up all of the numbers in the list seat_counts. Store that number in the variable total_seat_counts.

#B. Accumulator Variable: total_seats_so_far ; Iterator Variable: seat_count ✔️ Yes, this is the most clear combination.


#seqmut-11-16: Which of these are good alternatives to the accumulator variable and iterator variable names for the following prompt? Write code to print out each character of the string my_str on a separate line.

#C. Accumulator Variable: no variable needed ; Iterator Variable: char ✔️ Yes, there is no accumulator variable needed and the iterator variable is clear (char is a common short form of character)
